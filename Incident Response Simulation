Project: Incident Response Simulation

Description:
Led a simulated real-world cyber incident scenario to demonstrate proficiency in incident response management. Developed and executed a comprehensive response plan, encompassing incident detection, containment, eradication, and recovery strategies. Showcased the ability to handle security incidents effectively while minimizing the impact on business operations and preserving data integrity.

Key Contributions:
	- Designed and orchestrated a realistic cyber incident simulation, closely resembling actual attack scenarios, to assess the organization's incident response capabilities.
	- Developed a detailed incident response plan outlining predefined roles, responsibilities, and escalation procedures to ensure a coordinated and efficient response to the simulated incident.
	- Implemented robust detection mechanisms, leveraging intrusion detection systems (IDS), log analysis, and threat intelligence feeds to promptly identify and alert on suspicious activities.
	- Coordinated with cross-functional teams, including IT, security operations, legal, and management, to swiftly contain the incident, isolate affected systems, and prevent further compromise.
	- Conducted forensic analysis to determine the nature and extent of the breach, preserving evidence for legal and investigative purposes while minimizing disruption to ongoing operations.
	- Employed appropriate eradication techniques, such as malware removal, patching vulnerabilities, and resetting compromised credentials, to eliminate the attacker's foothold and prevent reinfection.
	- Collaborated with system administrators and stakeholders to develop and implement recovery strategies, including data restoration, system reconfiguration, and strengthening security controls.
	- Documented the entire incident response process, including timelines, actions taken, challenges encountered, and lessons learned, providing a valuable resource for future incident response improvement.
	- Conducted post-incident reviews and facilitated tabletop exercises to enhance incident response capabilities, identify areas for improvement, and ensure the organization's resilience against future incidents.

Technologies and Tools:
	- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions: Splunk, ELK Stack
	- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Snort, Suricata
